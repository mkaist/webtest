## Medical instruments
We develop new non-invasive medical instruments to extract new digital biomarkers, are convinient to use and come in miniature form-factor.

## Digital biosignal analytics
We create robust algortihms for extracting digital biomarkers from physilogical signals in various cardiac diseases and in hemodynamic monitoring.   

## Clinical machine learning
We aim to bring forth new methods for trustworty AI in high stakes medical decision making. We aim to develop understandable models and improved validation methodologies. A key research direction uses synthetic data for domain invariant models and for understanding model behaviour.

## Physical and biochemical sensors 
We create low-cost electrochemical sensors at the point-of-care. Our aim is to combine simple detection principles with new data analytics methods for sensors that are simple to use and do not require complicated labeling nor washing steps.
